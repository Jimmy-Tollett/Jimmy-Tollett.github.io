        <h3>CalPal</h3>
        <p>Worked on a development team for a class project to create an app called Calpal, a smart
          calendar app. Used Swift and Swift UI to work on the front end IOS app giving me experience
          with networking, UI and UX design, and collaborative teams as we had separate teams working
          on separate sections of the application. Despite slowing down on the project as a group over the
          summer, we hope to continue development to be able to bring the app to launch.</p>

        <h3>Guess The Line</h3>
        <p>My cousin has hosted a "guess the line" contest for several years. This year I decided to take it 
          upon myself to utilize the Demos API to create a better user experience for both the participants
          and for my cousin as he has to sort through and judge responses. The project uses the afformentioned 
          Demos API for the graph display and input handling, and uses Google's firebase for user Authentication
          and submission.</p>
